## 📌 Project Modules

### 1. Cohort-Based Recommender System

* **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, xgboost
* **Purpose**: Personalizes product or content recommendations using interpretable cohort-based segmentation
* **Features**:

  * RFM segmentation
  * Lightweight ranking models
  * Local deployment or API-ready design

### 2. Fraud Detection & Anomaly Pipeline

* **Tech Stack**: Prophet, IsolationForest, NumPy, Streamlit (dashboard demo)
* **Purpose**: Identifies bot traffic, rate-limit abuse, and messaging anomalies
* **Features**:

  * Time series anomaly modeling
  * Session and behavioral pattern analysis
  * Plug-and-play fraud scoring function

### 3. Uplift Modeling Toolkit

* **Tech Stack**: causalml, econml, matplotlib
* **Purpose**: Empowers ethical experimentation with uplift modeling and causal impact analysis
* **Features**:

  * A/B simulation engine
  * Covariate balancing diagnostics
  * Power calculation and MDE visualizations
