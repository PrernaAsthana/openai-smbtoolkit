# NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) Alignment â€“ OpenAI-SMBToolkit

This document outlines how the OpenAI-SMBToolkit aligns with the four core functions of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (January 2023): Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.

---

## ðŸ§­ 1. Govern

- The toolkit is built as an **open-access, public-benefit AI initiative** intended to serve U.S. SMBs and non-technical organizations.
- All modules will include **human-readable documentation**, transparent scoring logic, and fairness considerations.
- Governance practices include early publication, public code, and opt-in pilot case studies.

---

## ðŸ§­ 2. Map

- Intended use cases are clearly defined: ecommerce personalization, fraud detection in messaging systems, and causal experimentation for ethical decision-making.
- Stakeholder personas include U.S.-based SMB operators, marketers, platform engineers, and AI practitioners.
- Risk scenarios (e.g., model misuse, data bias, over-segmentation) are identified and will be addressed in each moduleâ€™s documentation.

---

## ðŸ§­ 3. Measure

- Toolkits include built-in **risk diagnostics**, such as:
  - Uplift model power and fairness bias checks
  - Anomaly detection thresholds and false-positive rates
  - Model explainability for cohort segmentation
- Performance metrics will be benchmarked through public pilots and anonymized case summaries.

---

## ðŸ§­ 4. Manage

- Pilot partners will receive **iterative model updates** and guidance on tuning thresholds based on business feedback.
- Ongoing improvements will be tracked via GitHub versioning, changelogs, and public feedback loops.
- Contributors will follow a contribution governance policy aligned with trustworthy AI guidelines.

This file is included as part of process to demonstrate that the proposed AI infrastructure is not only innovative, but **safe, accountable, and aligned with U.S. national AI risk standards**.
