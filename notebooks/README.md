## üß™ Recommender System Demo

**Filename:** `demo_recommender_system.ipynb`

Demonstrates an interpretable product recommendation approach using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation. Useful for:

* Lightweight targeting in retail or DTC commerce
* Campaign segmentation
* Early personalization without deep learning

---

## üîç Fraud Detection Simulation

**Filename:** `demo_fraud_detection.ipynb`

Simulates a time series anomaly detection approach to identify synthetic bot or API abuse patterns. Useful for:

* Monitoring messaging traffic spikes
* Detecting click fraud or rate-limit abuse
* Dashboard-ready simulation for pilot systems

---

## üìà Uplift Modeling Demo

**Filename:** `demo_uplift_modeling.ipynb`

Implements a two-model approach to estimate causal uplift in response to treatments (e.g., promotions, emails). Useful for:

* Ethical A/B testing
* Response modeling with fairness goals
* Maximizing marketing ROI based on true causal effect

## üì¶ Notes

These notebooks are synthetic demonstrations only and use toy data for proof-of-concept. Production versions will include advanced models, API wrappers, and reproducibility checks in alignment with NIST AI RMF standards.

For collaboration or pilot inquiries, see the [Pilot Implementation Form](../docs/PILOT_TEMPLATE.md) or contact the project lead.
